# WarspearAlike
Like I've already mentioned, it is an old-fashioned, or it would be better to say "retro" pixel RPG.
The main idea and fundamentals were brought by a Warspear.

Briefly, what is Warspear:
"Warspear Online is a mobile cross-platform massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) by Russian studio AIGRIND LLC. It supports different mobile platforms: iOS, Android,[1] Windows Mobile, Symbian[2] and Windows based PCs and laptops. First launch of the game was in 2008 and it was based on P2P model, in 2010 it was redesigned. In March, 2011 an update called Legacy of Berengar was launched. The game became F2P."

So, I decided to try and accomplish a 1 demo-level of a similar game. But before showing what we've got here, I would like to mention and to give my thanks to user ArMM1998 from opengameart.org, who has created such amazing art!
